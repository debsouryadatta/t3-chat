## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or later)
- pnpm (or your favorite package manager)
- A [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) account
- An [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) API key

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/debsouryadatta/t3-chat.git
cd t3-chat
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set up Convex

Log in to Convex and initialize the project. This command will guide you through setting up your backend.

```bash
pnpm convex dev
```

This will create a `convex.json` file and start the Convex development server. It will also provide you with the `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` URL.

### 4. Set up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add your Clerk credentials:

```.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_your_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_your_secret_key

# This is provided by `pnpm convex dev`
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your_convex_deployment_url
```

### 5. Configure Convex Dashboard

Now, add your Clerk and OpenAI secrets to the Convex dashboard. You can do this via the command line or by visiting your project on the [Convex dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/).

```bash
pnpm convex env set CLERK_ISSUER_URL https://your-issuer-url.clerk.accounts.dev
pnpm convex env set OPENAI_API_KEY sk_your_openai_api_key
```

- Find your **Clerk Issuer URL** in the Clerk dashboard under your project's API Keys section (it should be the "JWT issuer URL").
- Get your **OpenAI API Key** from the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

### 6. Run the application

Now you can start the Next.js development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application running.
